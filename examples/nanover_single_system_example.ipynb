    "# Introduction\n",
    "This tutorial provides a minimal working example demonstrating how to use the NanoVer-IMD visualisation package in conjunction with the parser package to render results derived from the analysis of Dynamical Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (D-NEMD) simulations. The walkthrough covers loading the data, configuring visualisation settings, and running the visualiser to display the displacement data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup\n",
    "Before proceeding, it is essential to ensure that all the required software is installed and correctly configured. The D-NEMD visualiser script necessitates a special feature branch of NanoVer-IMD to function properly. This specific version can be downloaded **[here](https://github.com/mcsloy/NanoVerNemdParser/releases/tag/Pre-release)**. Given that this script will not operate with any other branch of NanoVer-IMD it is the user's responsibility to verify that they are using the correct version of this software. No special installation instructions are necessary, as the binary executable can be downloaded and run directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "An up-to-date version of the NanoVer-protocol Python package is also required. It can be installed via Anaconda by issuing the command\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda install -c irl -c conda-forge nanover-server\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the NanoVer D-NEMD parser package contained within this repository must be download and installed like so:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:mcsloy/NanoVerNemdParser.git && cd NanoVerNemdParser\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",

A residue's scaling factor is determined via the following expression:\n",

The final factor is then used by the NanoVer client to scale the residue.\n",

By adjusting these parameters, users can control the degree to which displacement is reflected in the residue sizes, enhancing or reducing their visibility as needed.\n",

    "By default, both the minimum and maximum scale factors are set to 1.0, resulting in no scaling effect.
